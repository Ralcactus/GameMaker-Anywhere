### Todo (sorted from most to least needed)
- Custom variables
- Port to other platforms
- And a bunch more...

## compiling
compiling is currently only recommended with the test project, anything else is almost guaranteed not to work! (for now)

1. Open the gamemaker project in the folder "GMA_Compiler"
2. Select the yyp you'd like to compile
3. Give it a Game Name, Title ID, and Publisher (all don't do anything currently!)
4. Select your export mode and select export
5. Go to the path "C:\GM_Anywhere\Runner\output\\" and inside should be your exported build! (if not give it a second!)
