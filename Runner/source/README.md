# The code
### What the code does
- main: the main script and runs the code from the other scripts, it also opens the data.win.
- gml_runnner: the gml interpreter.
- gml_functions: holds the gm functions remade in C.
- cJSON: the json loader thingy (Not by me!)
- shortcut_functions: A quick shortcut to check things like the current platform being used.
- cross_platform: do specific code based on what platform is being used. for Eg: Run sdl2 on wii u, run Citro2d on 3ds.
